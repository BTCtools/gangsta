bitcoin replace-by-fee double spend tool

gangsta, untested bitcoin double spend tool aimed to work with replace-by-fee patched nodes

requirements to test:

- insight-api that runs on a replace-by-fee patched node (standard nodes got Code -25)
- text editor to change 'insight.bitpay.com' with your node host
- blockr needs to be app, entire app rely on its api


Todo: 
- testing :-)
- switch entire app to insight
- bugfix
- less (zero?) third-party api dependency


Bug reports, feedback, forks, pull reqs, blames, everything is appreciated.
